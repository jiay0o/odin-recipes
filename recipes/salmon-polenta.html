                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 450F.</li>
                <li>Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with nonstick spray.</li>
                <li>In a high powered blender or food processor, combine the parsley, basil, garlic, bread crumbs (or panko), olive oil, and salt. Blend until fully combined and minced. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Place the salmon fillets on the baking sheet and lay the tomatoes around the salmon.</li>
                <li>Spread 1/2 tablespoon of Dijon mustard onto each salmon fillet in a thin layer.</li>
                <li>Top each piece of salmon with a heaping spoonful of the herb mixture. Press down to make sure it attaches and forms a crust on each piece.</li>
                <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes or until the salmon is cooked and flaky throughout.</li>
                <li>While salmon is cooking, prepare the polenta. In a large heavy pan, bring the water to a boil. Add salt.</li>
                <li>Stir in the polenta and reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 15-20 minutes or until its thickened to your liking. Turn off the heat and stir in the goat cheese.</li>
                <li>Spoon some polenta into each bowl and top with salmon and tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper if needed. Enjoy!</li>
