                    <em>Tornado Omelette:</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4 eggs (large, organic) *makes 2 omelettes</li>
                        <li>Salt</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                    <em>Ginger Fried Rice:</em>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat a large non-stick skillet on medium heat. Add oil, ginger, and green onions and let it sizzle away for 30-60 seconds. When fragrant, add cold, day-old rice and break up large chunks with a wooden spoon. Add salt and pepper to taste. Toss a few times to combine and cook until rice is heated through and no longer hard, about 5-6 minutes. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Evenly divide Ginger Fried Rice into 2 portions. Scoop each portion into an 8-ounce ramekin, patting down with the back of a spoon. Turn upside down onto a plate. Remove ramekin, leaving behind a perfectly shaped mound of fried rice.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <em>Tornado Omelette:</em>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make 1 omelette at a time: Crack 2 eggs into a bowl and whisk well with a pinch of salt. Optional: put the eggs in a sieve for extra silky texture.</li>
                        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet on medium heat. When the pan is hot, add a little oil (about 1 tsp) and swirl around. Add eggs. They should immediately spread out into the pan. When you see bubbles and firm edges, grab the edges with chopsticks and move towards each other, leaving a gap between the chopstick ends. Turn the pan away from you while keeping the chopsticks in place, facing you. As the eggs cook and start twisting, keep turning the pan. Jiggle and shake the pan from time to time, so the uncooked egg will fall down to the bottom of the pan.</li>
                        <li>Plate Tornado Eggs immediately on top of fried rice. Repeat with 2nd omelette. Enjoy!</li>
                    </ol>
